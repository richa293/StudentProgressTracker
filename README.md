StudentProgressTracker

This project was built to automate the then manual process of keeping a track of students' performance during the Student Leadership Program conducted by Indian Development Foundation. On deploying, we successfully saved more than 70 work hours per month.
We also saw a substantial improvement in the performance of students, since our reports helped in course structure planning and customised plans for each student.
